# Helsinki XR Center â€“ Coding Task 2025

## Explain how you would improve the overall user experience

1. Add a landing page/start page with explanation about tarot and how to use the app.
2. Improve experience and responsiveness on mobile.
3. Add more interactions and feedback, e.g. sounds.
4. Add a visual cue that the card deck is interactable (shuffles on click), e.g. glowing outline.
5. Add meaning of each card and reading interpretations after dealing.
6. Separate views for: select number of cards --> deal cards --> show readings.

## Propose ideas on how to gamify the Tarot app if given a full week to develop

1. Add a functionality where user can select themes or ask a question.
2. Make it about learning how to read tarot cards.
